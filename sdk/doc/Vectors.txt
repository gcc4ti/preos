Some vectors are used by the kernel:

$30.w	: version of the kernel.

$32.w	: OS identifier:
	+ 'DT' for DoorsOS
	+ 'UO' for Universal Os
	+ 'TO' for Teos
	+ 'PO' for PreOS
	+ 'RO' for PedroM (based on PreOS)
	+ 'KN' for KerNo
	+ 'TI' for TitaniK
	
$34.l	: adress of the exec function (Program '68kP' only).
	Input:
		address of the program to execute + 4 pushed on the stack
	destroy:
		a0-a1/d0-d2

$38.l	: adress of the reloc function
	input :
		d0.w : handle to the file to relocate
	output:
		d0.w : result of the relocation (0 if no error else an error code depending of the kernel).
		a0.l : adress of the name of the library which caused the error (if there was an error)
	destroy:
		a0/d0

$3C.l	: adress of the reloc2 function
	input:
		a6.l : the adress to the very first instruction of the prog (the beginning of the file)
	output:
		d0.w : result of the relocation (0 if no error else an error code depending of the kernel).
		a0.l : adress of the name of the library which caused the error (if there was an error)
	destroy:
		a0/d0

$40.l	: adress of the unreloc function
	input :
		d0.w : handle to the file to unrelocate
	destroy:
		a0/d0

$44.l	: adress of the unreloc2 function
	input:
		a6.l : the adress to the very first instruction of the prog (the beginning of the file)
	destroy:
		a0/d0

$48.w	: handle of the memory block containing the kernel.
	This block is to be freed if you want to uninstall the kernel
	But it isn't the only thing to uninstall, so use the uninstall program !
	
$50.l	: adress of the generalised 'exec' function.
	It runs any recognized kernel programs (Program '68kP' and Program Archive '68aC').
	Input:
		address of the program to execute + 4 pushed on the stack
	destroy:
		a0-a1/d0-d2
	Note:
		The kernel MUST check the signature, and do nothing if it doesn't recognize it.
		For '68kP' programs, you could try vector $34.l too since it is the normal way to call a '68kP'.
		Not all kernels support the running of '68kP' through this vector.
		
$E0.l: saved auto-int1 (it is the copy to reinstall in case of a nostub crash).
$E4.l: saved auto-int2 (it is the copy to reinstall in case of a nostub crash).
$E8.l: saved auto-int3 (it is the copy to reinstall in case of a nostub crash).
$EC.l: saved auto-int4 (it is the copy to reinstall in case of a nostub crash).
$F0.l: saved auto-int5 (it is the copy to reinstall in case of a nostub crash).
$F4.l: saved auto-int6 (it is the copy to reinstall in case of a nostub crash).
$F8.l: saved auto-int7 (it is the copy to reinstall in case of a nostub crash).
$FC.l: Reserved
