; when you compress a file with PACKER92.exe. But here it isn't useful,
; because the number of the file to uncompress is indicated by a counter,
; that is initialized to #0 (1st file) and counts up to 4 (5th file).
; Just for those who are interested, the file is included within the .zip
; file. it is named sample1.inc.
