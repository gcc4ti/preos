	  INTRODUCTION
	-----------------

PACKER - 92 is a tool for compressing data for Fargo programs. These Data
can be any kind of graphics, texts or even a68k - data definitions. The
compression is made on a PC with the program PACKER92.exe The compressed
file can be included with the Fargo program by the INCBIN - directive, and
is uncompressed by the function pk92lib::Extract. The algorithm which is
used by PACKER92.exe combines some kind of an Entropy-, Lempel-Ziv-
and Run-Length-Encoding. My implementations of those algorithms are very
speed-optimized, and therefore quite ineffective. But in combination they
become more powerful, and are quite a bit better than Huffman.

Beside PACKER92, there are 2 other programs (not included here), that use
this algorithm. PK92SFX - that creates self-extracting fargo programms of
other .92p-fargo progies, and UGPCONV (+UGPLIB), which converts .tga - files
to a special graphics format for Fargo programs, called UGP (united graphics),
that can contain the picture-data packer92 - compressed.

If you want to use it, you should first read this doc completely. I hope
it contains all neccessary information, you will need. If you aren't shure
about some things, look at the samples, or write me an email.


NEW IN THIS VERSION:
  * Now archives greater than 32767 bytes work. (But Fargo programms greater
    than 32767 bytes still cause problems - but this is not my fault).
  * I corrected some very bad english mistakes within this file.
  * Fixed a little bug within the percent display routine for Normal
    Archives
  * I also fixed some bugs within the include file creation. (Especially for
    Solid archives)
  * Now you can use wildcards, to specify an input file. (In fact, you could
    do this also in older versions, but I didn't know that. - special feature
    of the DJGPP compiler)

	-----------------
	  PACKER92.exe
	-----------------

The compression-program, PACKER92.exe, is quite slow since it was completely
written in C (The assembler-prototye was 10 times faster). But therefore
I can now port it to every system like Macintosh & Co. PACKER92.exe was
first developed with a TC 3.0 - compiler. But then I got the DJGPP - C
compiler, which compiled so optimized, that the new PACKER92.exe run about
2 times faster than the TC 3.0 - compiled one!!! If you are a C - programer,
and you haven't got DJGPP, you can download it from >http://www.delorie.com<.


PACKER92.exe's syntax is the following:

PACKER92 -X [@]sourcefile1 [@]sourcefile2 ... destinationfile

-X	specifies the archive's type. It can be -d (divided), -n (normal),
	-s (solid) and -p (program data).
	These types are discussed later.
sourcefileX is a sourcefile. You can include up to 255 sources.
	Sourcefiles should never be greater than 65535 Bytes.
        You can use wildcards, like '*.*' or 'pic??.bin'. These files will
        be processed in alphabetical order.
@sourcefileX is a list-file. This list file can contain the names of sources,
	divided by line-breaks. e.g.:

		listfile.par
		------------
	c:\pictures\pic1.2bp
	c:\pictures\pic2.2bp
	c:\pictures\pic3.2bp
	c:\pictures\pic4.2bp
	c:\pictures\pic5.2bp
		-------------

	The files can be compressed by:
	  PACKER92 -n @listfile.par archive.p92
	This is the same like:
	  PACKER92 -n c:\pictures\pic1.2bp c:\pictures\pic2.2bp c:\pictures\pi
	  c3.2bp c:\pictures\pic4.2bp c:\pictures\pic5.2bp archive.p92

destinationfile specifies the destination file. The destination should
	NEVER become greater than 65535 Bytes. Else strange things might
	happen...

	Additional to the destination file, a file with the same name, but
	ending on .inc is created. This file contains some equ-macros for
	accessing the archive more easyly.

	-----------------
	  Archive Types
	-----------------

To understand the difference between the archive-types, you should know a
little bit about how PACKER92 works. The algorithm optimizes the following
things:
	* Frequenly bytes get shorter codes than seldom bytes. To uncompress
	  this kind of compression, the archive must contain a Translation
	  Table.
	* Repetitions of byte-patterns (e.g.: "abc abc")can be compressed,
	  by writing a Match Tag into the archive, that points to the
	  location, where the pattern is again. These Match Tags can only
	  point backwards. Match tags for short distances can be coded
	  shorter than those for long distances.
	* Repetitions of one byte (e.g. "iiiiiii") can be coded as "Byte X
	  repeats XXXX times".

-d Divided Archive type:
	Divided archives consist of 1 to 255 files, that have all their
	own Translation Table. Each file can be uncompressed seperatly.
	Match Tags can't point to data in other	files. This type should
	be used for big and different data (e.g. pictures and texts in
	one archive)
        I don't know, whether the name 'divided' matches very well, what
        this archive should be, 'seperated' is perhaps better. However,
        I realized this fault to late, to correct it in all files where
        it is used (and I'm too lazy).
-n Normal Archive type:
	Is almost the same as the Divided Archive Type, but it has only
	one translation table for all files. That's why it compresses
	each file itsself less optimal, but needs less space for
	translation tables. It is very practical for small, and similar
	data (many texts or pictures in one archive). This type is almost
	allways the best one.
-s Solid Archive type:
	Solid Archives are very different to Divided and Normal Archives.
	A Solid Archive contains only one compressed block, that contains
	all files. That's why you can only uncompress all files at once.
	To access the different files, you have to use the .inc file.
	e.g. if a1 points to the uncompressed block, and the archive
	contains File1.txt and File2.txt, you can access them by
	file1_txt(a1) and file2_txt(a1). The opposite of Solid Archives
	is, that Match Tags can point to locations in the other files.
	That's why this Archive type can be compressed very good. You
	should use it for small files, that have to be used all together.
	(e.g. many little pictures, that are shown on the screen at once)
-p Program Data Archive type:
	Program Data archives were made up by a68k data definitions. They
	can be accessed like Solid Archives. (In fact they have exactly
	the same structure like Solid Archives)
	PACKER92 excepts the following data types:
	dc.b, dc.w, dc.l, ds.b, ds.w, ds.l
	Numbers can be dezimal (e.g. 10), hexadezimal (e.g. $A) or binary
	(e.g. %1010)
	Example:
		    prgmdat.asm
		   -------------

	String1:	dc.b "Hello World",0
	String2:	dc.b "Hello2",0
	OtherData:	dc.w 0, 0, 0, 0
			dc.l 0, 1, 1, 1
			dc.l %1110000000111
			dc.w $FFFF
	TempData	ds.b 256

		   --------------

	compression: PACKER92 -d prgmdat.asm prgmdat.p92

	When a1 points to the uncompressed data (after you extracted them
	with pk92lib::Extract) you can access them with the help of the
        equates defined in the prgmdat.inc, which is created automatically,
        as:

                include "prgmdat.inc"
	String1(a1)
	String2(a1)
	OtherData(a1)
	TempData(a1)

	Perhaps you wonder, why to use ds.b, to allocate memory inside a
	compressed file, but this is quite practical. ds.b 256 is translated
	to 256 bytes with the value 0. These bytes are stored in the archive
	as a repetition, and take only 3-5 bytes. This is much less, than the
	program code, that would be neccessary to allocate memory dynamically
	by tios::HeapAlloc. Program Data archives can be used like normal
	program data, but have the opposite, that every time when they are
	uncompressed, the data are the same, even if they were modified
	by the progam. (e.g. you don't have to initialize a ds.b 256 - array
        every time the program is executed)

Error Messages:
      All errors, that are returned by PACKER92.exe should be self-explaining.
      If the error occures during parsing in a program data file, it will
      have the following format:
         [xxxx] ERROR: errormessage
      xxxx will be the line-number, in the program data file, where the parser
      didn't understand something. (e.g. dc.y "Ha Ha, you can't parse me")

	-----------------------------
	  The Uncompression Routine
	-----------------------------

To uncompress any kind of PACKER92 - Archives you allways use the same
routine, pk92lib::Extract.
It's parameters are:
    a0.l = pointer to archives' begin (mustn't be odd)
    d0.w = number of file (not neccessary for Solid and Program Data
	   Archives) 0 = 1st file, 1 = 2nd file, 2 = 3rd file...
Return-Values:
    d0.b = 0 OK
    d0.b = $FF Error
    a1   = pointer to uncompressed file
    d1.w = handle of uncompressed file
    d2.l = Length of uncompressed file
    All other registers stay as they are.

    The error code, d0.b = $FF, can be caused by different things:
      * there is not enough memory, to uncompress the file
	(the uncompression routine itsself needs NO memory)
      * the archive type is unknown
      * the archive extracted more byte, than the header of the compressed
        file said.
    NOTE: The uncompression routine is optimized on beeing small and fast,
	  not on choosing, which archive is the right one.
	  (e.g. if you want to uncompress file #255 in an archive, that
	  has only 3 files, it won't report an error)

If you used the Divided or Normal Archive type, the file-numbers are
defined in the .inc - file, together with their length.

Example: When you compressed File1.2bp and File2.2bp, than the .inc file
	 looks like the following:

			sample.inc
		       ------------

 *-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

 *************************************************************************


	;Archive type: NORMAL

 file1_2bp EQU 0			;Number of file1.2bp

 file2_2bpl EQU 3072			;Length of file2.2bp

		       ------------

Header files for Program and Solid Archives allways contain the offsets
of the labels (Program Data) or of the files (Solid Archives).
Example:
   PACKER92 -s file1.2bp file2.2bp file3.2bp sample.p92
   will create the following header file:

			sample.inc

		       ------------

Additional to the function pk92lib::Extract, there is another function,
pk92lib::FreeMem, that automatically unallocates the memory, allocated
by Extract. This works, because the library allways stores the handle
of the file, that was uncompressed.

Example:
        include "pk92lib.h"
        include "archive.inc"

	lea  Archive(PC), a0	       ;pointer to compressed data
	move.w	#File1_pic, d0         ;uncompress file1.pic
	jsr	pk92lib::Extract
	bsr	ShowPic_pointedby_a1
	jsr	pk92lib::FreeMem
        rts

NOTE: This is just an example, not a complete program.

For further information watch the sample files.
NOTE: 	If you want to compile these files, you will have to change the
	directories in the include commands.

	--------------
	  Known Bugs
	--------------

I wouldn't have put it anywhere, If I had known, that there are bugs in it.
If you think you found one (I hope you won't), email me.
Some things that might look like bugs:
        * You put an archive into the programm, and the programm became bigger
          than 32767 bytes. Fargo doesn't support such huge files.
        * You didn't aligned an archive at an odd address. This could cause
          an Address Mode error. To align it, put a "ds.w 0" before it.

If you haven't got an IBM - PC, write me a mail, and I will send you the
sources, that you can compile them (you would need a C - compiler).
I will also be ok to send you the sources, if you want to use my packer
